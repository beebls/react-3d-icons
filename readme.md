A simple and easy-to-use library for adding 3d icons into any React project.

## Example

![Gif Demonstration](https://i.imgur.com/P6y8rJk.gif)

The library provides thousands of icons ready to go, and can be extended with any SVG you want.

## Installation

ThreeJS and React Three Fiber are expected to already be installed in the project.

```sh
npm install three @react-three/fiber

npm install react-3d-icons
```

## How to use

Import the Icon element:

```javascript
import { Icon } from "react-3d-icons";
```

Import icon(s) you would like to use (full list below):

```javascript
import { twitter, github } from "react-3d-icons";
```

Add the Icon element and specify your icon as well as any other parameters.  
If size is unspecified, the icon's canvas will fill the size of its parent.

```javascript
<Icon file={twitter} color={"#1DA1F2"} scale={10} style={{ height: "100px", width: "100px" }} />

<div style={{ height: "150px", width: "150px" }}>
  <Icon file={github} color={'#1c1c1c'} scale={10}/>
</div>

```

Voila! Your icon is now display and can be treated as any other image or text element.

## Opening Links

You can pass any url into the 'link' property of the Icon element, and clicking on the icon will open that link in a new tab.

```javascript
<Icon file={npm} link='https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-3d-icons' />
```

## Icons

The npm package comes pre-configured with the entire [simpleicons.org](https://simpleicons.org/) catalogue.  
The import names are lowercase, without spaces, and numbers & periods have been converted to words.  
(Ex: Twitter -> twitter, Google Maps -> googlemaps, About.me -> aboutdotme, 1Password -> onepassword)

```javascript
import { twitter } from "react-3d-icons";

<Icon file='mylogo' />;
```

Additionally, you can import your own SVGs, and pass references to them into the 'file' property.

React Example:

```javascript
import { mylogo } from "./icons/logo.svg";

<Icon file='mylogo' />;
```

## Customization

The Icon component comes with properties which you can customize to change how your icon looks and behaves.
